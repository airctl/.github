# AIRCTL Project

We are AIRCTL -- a collaborative and open project for **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence **R**esponse & **C**on**T**ro**L**. AIRCTL leverages community collaborative effort to provide resources for Incident Management professionals to run Game Days and test their skills at responding to realistic incidents.

We provide resources for Incident Management teams to run simulated incidents for their own organization, learn how to improve their own readiness, and gain skills even if there's no AI-capable members of the incident handling or security operations team.

### What we are up to
Right now we are working on an AI-relevant expansion for Backdoors & Breaches, the tabletop RPG by Black Hills Information Security. We are also writing the trainings and materials and engaging the community around this to make sure we get it right.

We think this includes:

- AI RPG with online emulator, to simulate realistic Artificial Intelligence Incidents and their response at any location without requiring external faciliation. Try it now: https://airctl.github.io/
- AI Incident Commander Play Guides, to help incident teams understand how to develop awareness of their organization's Incident Management readiness for AI Incidents
- AI Incident Quick-Play Scenarios, to allow Incident teams with no AI experience to upskill their novice incident personnel through knowledge transfer and collaborative thinking on the highest-value AI Incident topics (community-contributed based on evidenced, validated priorities).

We are open to suggestions on anything else we should do next. Comment Box --> https://forms.gle/Yjaq9eZoeqaT4wAJ6

### Why this matters
Despite the enormous effort in so many ways and channels to advance security of AI by characterizing the challenges of AI, we know that readiness is critical to the ability of anyone to address risks once realized.

We see the need to bring the community together to solution and prepare for bad days with AI systems and programs, may we never see them.

### Why did you decide to start AIRCTL? 
Emily and Jonathan were ruining too many local functions with AI specific discussions. In spring of 2024, we started to write them all down together when it became clear that we weren't stopping and neither were the needs, and we kicked off community from AIRCTL at HACKBOAT 2024 with our first alpha test of AIRCTL B&B.

### BSidesPDX - October 2024

*Incident Response for Artificial Intelligence: Playtest New Tabletop Exercises with the AIRCTL Project for fun and stickers*

> Learn how to respond to security incidents involving Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the AIRCTL Project team. Join this hands-on workshop about preparing for common incident response (IR) scenarios using tabletop exercises. We will facilitate playtesting of a pre-release AI-themed expansion to Backdoors and Breaches, the tabletop game by Black Hills Information Security. In three sections of instructor-guided learning, participants will learn how to run a realistic tabletop IR exercise for an environment where your job is to protect cutting edge AI technology and R&D assets. NO artificial intelligence experience needed to play! 

> Participants will attend an introductory briefing by the AIRCTL team on AI for security professionals, four common types of AI incidents, and the mechanics of the Backdoors & Breaches tabletop IR game.

> Participants will then form teams, get guidance for your scenario, and breakout to roleplay as an Incident Responder or Incident Commander for a facilitated playtest of one of the common AI incident scenarios: R&D compromise, material breach via AI path, AI defacement & manipulation, AI exploitation.

> Be prepared to commit at least one hour to the session to experience all segments. The intro briefing is 10 minutes with short Q&A. Each game scenario takes 30-60 minutes for play, depending on the IR team. Debrief discussion and exit survey will take roughly 20 minutes. An optional “all hands” debrief will follow.

> Participants who playtest any of the AIRCTL Project IR scenarios and share their experiences and ideas as feedback will be eligible for playtester credit on the AIRCTL pages — we want to see the community win and appreciate your time with us has value. We will be sharing a limited number of printed game materials, which attendees can take home. The session will not be recorded but notes and photos with consent are welcome.
